## Overview
- This is a great project where i successfully tested and improved my knowledge of a combination of javscript,template-        literal to embed my fetched data with both html and javscript.
- would have been easier with frameworks like React and nextjs but i feel more at ease testing my knowledge without frameworks.this every other person can do.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process
- I started by feeling up the data not the json file but in the given starter file with html.
- With a fetch api (promise),i imported the files and filed the html with the file using javscript
  and a combination of template-literal.
- I styled the file with a combination of css flex and grid
- With mobile first layout style and with the help of media query i style the desktop version too.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javscript (json-template-literal)

### Continued development

- i will work more with json data to update and fill up my HTML as am still new to this for mastery
